    "Then, if $z_1=0$, meaning that Ted does not ship to retailer $R1$, then the quantity in the brackets is $1$ and, therefore, the penalty of $20\\cdot47=940$ gets counted. On the flip side, if $z_1=1$, meaning that Ted does ship to retailer $R1$, then the quantity in the brackets is $0$ and, therefore, no penalty gets counted.\n",
